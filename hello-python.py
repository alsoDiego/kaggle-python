# Question 0
# create a variable called color with an appropriate value on the line below
# (Remember, strings in Python must be enclosed in 'single' or "double" quotes)
color = "blue"

# Question 1
pi = 3.14159 # approximate
diameter = 3

# Create a variable called 'radius' equal to half the diameter
radius = diameter/2

# Create a variable called 'area', using the formula for the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared
area = pi * radius ** 2

# Question 2
########### Setup code - don't touch this part ######################
# If you're curious, these are examples of lists. We'll talk about 
# them in depth a few lessons from now. For now, just know that they're
# yet another type of Python object, like int or float.
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [3, 2, 1]
q2.store_original_ids()

# Your code goes here. Swap the values to which a and b refer.
# If you get stuck, you can always uncomment one or both of the lines in
# the next cell for a hint, or to peek at the solution.
c = a # temp variable
a = b
b = c
