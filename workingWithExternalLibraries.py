# Given solution:
"""
Solution: Luigi used the variable name i to represent each item in racer['items']. However, he also used i as the loop variable for the outer loop (for i in range(len(racers))). These i's are clobbering each other. This becomes a problem only if we encounter a racer with a finish of 1 and a name of None. If that happens, when we try to print the "WARNING" message, i refers to a string like "green shell", which python can't add to an integer, hence a TypeError.

This is similar to the issue we saw when we imported * from math and numpy. They both contained variables called log, and the one we got when we tried to call it was the wrong one.

We can fix this by using different loop variables for the inner and outer loops. i wasn't a very good variable name for the inner loop anyways. for item in racer['items'] fixes the bug and is easier to read.

Variable shadowing bugs like this don't come up super often, but when they do they can take an infuriating amount of time to diagnose!

# Given solution:
def hand_total(hand):
    """
    Return True if hand_1 beats hand_2, and False otherwise.
    
    In order for hand_1 to beat hand_2 the following must be true:
    - The total of hand_1 must not exceed 21
    - The total of hand_1 must exceed the total of hand_2 OR hand_2's total must exceed 21
    
    Hands are represented as a list of cards. Each card is represented by a string.
    
    When adding up a hand's total, cards with numbers count for that many points. Face
    cards ('J', 'Q', and 'K') are worth 10 points. 'A' can count for 1 or 11.
    
    When determining a hand's total, you should try to count aces in the way that 
    maximizes the hand's total without going over 21. e.g. the total of ['A', 'A', '9'] is 21,
    the total of ['A', 'A', '9', '3'] is 14.
    
    Examples:
    >>> blackjack_hand_greater_than(['K'], ['3', '4'])
    True
    >>> blackjack_hand_greater_than(['K'], ['10'])
    False
    >>> blackjack_hand_greater_than(['K', 'K', '2'], ['3'])
    False
